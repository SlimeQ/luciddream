# Installation & Usage

You need to have [pycaffe and all its dependencies](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) installed in order to run this. You will also need a long list of python modules, Node.js, and Python 2.7. Once cloned, simply run

    npm install
    node .

This starts the Node.js server on port 8080 and the python server on an arbitrary open port. Navigate to http://yourserver:8080 to begin.
